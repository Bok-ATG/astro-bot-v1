# AstroBot

A Slack bot that integrates with OpenAI's Assistants API to answer student questions using textbook documents. Designed for use in public channels where students can ask questions and see responses.

## Overview

AstroBot is a Slack application that uses OpenAI's Assistants API to respond to messages and events. The bot has three main components:

- **Textbook Bot**: Answers questions based on uploaded documents
- **Vision Bot**: Analyzes and describes images shared in channels
- **Summary Bot**: Generates summaries of channel activity
- **Slash Commands**:
  - `/generate-summary` - Posts a summary of recent activity
  - `/bot-stats` - Shows stats about the botâ€™s activity
  - `/help` - Provides a help message listing

The bot uses Slack's [socket mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/socket-mode) for event handling, which does not require exposing a public HTTP Request URL.
